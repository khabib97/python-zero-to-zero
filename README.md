 # Programming Zero To 0
Many individuals with non-CS backgrounds often find programming a bit challenging. Figuring out where to start can be time-consuming and confusing. At times like these, something as straightforward and digestible as a super easy solution is needed.

When programming, if you keep the subjects of computer science at a distance, learning to write code becomes more approachable. Although these subjects will be needed later for writing good code.

If you know the word "Zero" in English, you can now write 0 on the computer. We'll cover very basic topics.

There won't be anything difficult. There won't be many expectations. Let's see what happens.
